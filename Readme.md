ffmk â€” a farbfeld recipe parser
===============================

This perl script is able to parse a specific input file (see `demo.fm` for
syntax) and call the farbfeld tools specified. It is possible to include
mathematical expressions (inside `[]`) and use variables. These variables are
simple text replacements and are replaced before the mathematical expressions.

**At the moment this tool is not usable! It lacks fundamental functionality
and is only able to parse. It is _not_ capable of forking and calling the
specified processes. This will be added at the next stage!**
